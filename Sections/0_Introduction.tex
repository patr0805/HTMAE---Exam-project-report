% What is the motivation to build your device? Why is this important (at least to you)?

\section{Introduction}
The question of how to make materialistic inventions have over the years become more accessible. The process from idea to prototype or even product is now possible with devices such as 3D printers, laser cutters, advanced software and electronics and much more. Out of the interest to test all these devices we decided on creating a Drawing Machine. The motivation for the project comes from an earlier attempt to make a rail-based drawing machine, but due to expensive rails and a lot of waiting on products from China kept delaying the project. With the possibilities at The IT-University of Copenhagen (ITU), it then came to mind if the Drawing Machine could be made in a cheaper and more efficient way. Another motivation is, that the project is complex enough for sufficient exploration of fabrication methods and mechanics. Furthermore it can be scalable in the form of expectation and features.
