\section{Requirements}
The drawing machine should be able to draw on a vertical plane by controlling the line length from two stepper motors to a drawing head. The input should be given as a set of coordinates or an image, and the drawing machine should be able to adjust the line length so as to draw through the desired coordinates. In case of an image, the machine should be able to segment using a threshold, the pixels that need coloring, and deduct an ordered list of coordinates to do so.
