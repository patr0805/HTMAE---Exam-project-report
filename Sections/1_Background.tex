%Group Report Information: Has this been done before? How? If not, what's the closest related device/prototype? Is there any novelty in your device? (It is not necessary that your device is novel) Did you use an existing project as inspiration or starting point??

\section{Background}
There are a number of projects that does the same thing as our machine, that is drawing to a vertical surface by pulling/releasing a wire. An example is a video found on Vimeo\citep{Vimio:2010:DrawingMachine} by Harvey Moon. It has two motors placed in the upper right and left of a whiteboard. Then a motor in each has a pulley structure on the shaft that may release/pull a wire. This wire from both motors connects a pen which by gravity is forced down.\\

The projects above provides some inspirational material, however ideas such as the pulley setup is something we only stumped upon by background checking while report writing. It is an idea that could have improved accuracy of the solution we ended up with. Then there are 3D printers which is a related device that is quite an inspiration. It shows how steppers can be used to move a head in 3 dimensions, but it is also quite expensive to just buy a smooth rod for the project.
