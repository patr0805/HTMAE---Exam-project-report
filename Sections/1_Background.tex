%Group Report Information: Has this been done before? How? If not, what's the closest related device/prototype? Is there any novelty in your device? (It is not necessary that your device is novel) Did you use an existing project as inspiration or starting point??

\section{Background}
It is fair to say that a drawing machine is not something new. There are a number of projects that is drawing to a vertical surface by pulling/releasing a wire such as our machine. An example is a video found on Vimeo\citep{Vimio:2010:DrawingMachine} by Harvey Moon. It has two motors placed in the upper right and left of a whiteboard. Then a motor in each has a pulley structure on the shaft that may release/pull a wire. This wire from both motors connects a pen which by gravity is forced down.\\ Another project called Hektor, is  a spraycan drawing on walls in the vertical plane. The spray-can is controlled by two stepper motors\citep{Lehni:2002:Hektor}. Then there are 3D printers which is a related device that is quite an inspiration. It shows how steppers can be used to move a head in 3 dimensions, but it is also quite expensive to just buy a smooth rod for the project.\\

The projects above provides some inspirational material, however the Drawing Machine of ours is based on our own ideas, code and experience.  We did not seek inspiration for the project until writing this report. Ideas such as the pulley setup from Harvey Moon is something we could have stumbled upon earlier. It is an idea that could have improved accuracy of the solution we ended up with.
